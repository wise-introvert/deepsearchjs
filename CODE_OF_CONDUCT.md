- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events

We expect everyone to follow these rules in all project-related venues, including the Github repository, NPM, and in any other online or offline venues.
